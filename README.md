#### Project Description

NiftyTheta is a Mobile-First NFT Marketplace. Marketplaces like Opensea are not Completely trustless. NFTs created using Opensea exists on Opensea StoreFront Contract. NiftyTheta solves this problem all the NFTs created on the NiftyTheta Platform all 100% owned by the creator. This is because every user gets its own NFT collection to mint NFTs from.

We intend to focus on onboarding influencers first by doing beta-access and then opening up the platform for everyone!

#### Summary

NiftyTheta currently is a No-Code NFT Marketplace. Soon we will allow permissionless Social Token launches making NiftyTheta permissionless token launcher. Finally we will move towards governance by allowing creators to decentralized their profile. Setting up Snapshot, Discourse and DAO infrastructure is cumbersome. NiftyTheta solves all this problems by providing a No-Code solution and making Web3 more accessible to the masses.
